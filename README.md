# Kursk-Rework

Attempt to refactor KurskGrad using various node build tools, initiall making use of gulp, pug and stylus.

Long term I'd like to make use of Vue.js but that is something that I'm not sure is compatible with pug and the Vue.js template uses Webpack, which I'm unfamiliar with. Nor am I sure there is any support for Vue with Gulp.

Time will tell!
